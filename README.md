2. Clone this repository:

        $ git clone https://github.com/roganro/jekyll-solana-pagan-pratama.git
        $ cd jekyll-solana-pagan-pratama

Usage
-----

### Customizing the theme

Edit the data in `_config.yml` as appropriate. You’ll also want to rewrite the `README` and replace identifying graphics (`/i/avatar.png`, `/favicon.ico`) with your own.

### Creating new posts

As with any Jekyll site, posts are generated from Markdown files placed in the `_posts` directory, and must be named according to the following format: `<year>-<month>-<day>-<url_slug>.md`. See the sample posts for examples of how to format rich text in Markdown.

Post content must be preceded by [YAML frontmatter][doc-fm] describing, at a minimum, the title of the post. Keep titles under 60 characters, and teasers under 160.

### Categories & Tags

This repository automatically generates “category” and “tag” archive pages based on labels provided by you in each post’s aforementioned YAML frontmatter. This feature is not available through Jekyll itself or the plugins approved for use on GitHub Pages, so it has been implemented using [git hooks][ghk].

To enable this feature, run the following command from the project root:

```
$ ln -s ../../.scripts/pre-commit.rb .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

Now, these scripts will run every time you `git commit`, ensuring that your categories and tags pages always stay up-to-date.

### Page

This repository automatically generates archives pages, You can modify it by editing `_config.yml`, create a directory according to the page that you created in `_config.yml`

├── jekyll-solana-pagan-pratama
|   └── archives (This is an example directory that I created, you can change it)
│       └── index.html

and place the posts created for pages like this

├── jekyll-solana-pagan-pratama
|   └── _posts
│       ├── post_for_the_main_page.md
│       └── archives (You can change it according to the page you created)
│           └── post_for_archives_page.markdown

#### Explanation

Solana implements categories and tags as [‘collections’][doc-col], meaning each has its own top-level directory in the project root (`/_category` & `/_tag`). Inside these directories, there is a file representing each category or tag.

These files are generated by `/.scripts/spawn_labels.rb`, based on the `category:` and `tags:` attributes listed at the top of each post. The wrapper script `/.scripts/pre-commit.rb` calls this first script, then adds the newly created files to the git repo.

### Comments

As a static site generator, Jekyll has no means to provide a commenting system. For this theme, discussion is outsourced to disqus, and requires some manual intervention. The process is as follows:

1. Login to disqus

2. Add disqus to site

3. Copy and paste the Universal Embed Code under post.html layout

```{% comment %}
{% endcomment %}

{% if page.comments %}
<section class="comments">
<h2>Comments</h2>
<div id="disqus_thread"></div>

// You can paste the Universal Embed Code from disqus here

</section>         
{% endif %}```
